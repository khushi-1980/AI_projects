## üìå Project 1: 8-Puzzle Problem

The **8-puzzle** is a sliding tile puzzle consisting of a 3√ó3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space. The objective is to reach the goal state by sliding tiles into the empty space using a series of valid moves.

This problem is commonly used to demonstrate search algorithms and heuristic-based problem-solving in AI.
